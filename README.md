This project, developed during a 24-hour hackathon, aims to bridge the gap between home-cooked food and those who need it mostâ€”migrated students and employees in Mumbai. Our platform connects local housewives, who prepare home-cooked meals as cloud kitchens, with customers seeking healthy and convenient tiffin services.

# Problem Statement 
Students, office workers, and migrants living in Mumbai often struggle to find healthy, home-cooked meals. They usually resort to ordering food from restaurants or relying on instant meals, which may lack the nutritional value of freshly prepared food. Housewives who are skilled in cooking but do not have a source of income or any exposure to market their daily tiffin services are unable to capitalize on their culinary skills. The city faces high unemployment rates, particularly among low-income groups, and this project aims to create job opportunities by employing individuals in food delivery services. 

# Description 

This project is a tiffin management system built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) to connect housewives and home-based chefs with customers who need fresh, home-cooked meals delivered to their doorstep. The platform allows housewives and small kitchen owners to register as cloud kitchens and list their tiffin services with daily or weekly meal plans. 
Customers, such as students and office workers, can browse these listings, view menus, and subscribe to meal plans according to their preferences. The platform also integrates a delivery network, providing employment opportunities for individuals who want to work as food delivery personnel. By onboarding housewives and local chefs, the project aims to create an ecosystem that promotes healthy eating habits while providing a source of income for home cooks and delivery personnel. 

# Features Implemented 
User Authentication & Authorization: Secure user login and registration for customers and cloud kitchens. 
Cloud Kitchen Registration: Housewives and small kitchen owners can register, upload menus, set meal prices, and manage orders. 
Meal Plans & Subscription: Customers can view cloud kitchens' daily or weekly meal plans, choose their preferred meals, and subscribe to plans. 
Order Management: Customers can place orders, view order history, and provide ratings for meals received. 
Delivery Management: Integration of a delivery network that allows delivery personnel to receive orders, update order status, and deliver meals efficiently. 
Payment Integration: Secure payment gateway for seamless order transactions. 
Review System: Customers can leave feedback and reviews for cloud kitchens to ensure quality service.

# Technologies Used

Frontend: React.js 
Backend: Node.js and Express.js 
Database: MongoDB 
API Integration: Payment Gateway API and Geospatial APIs for delivery tracking 

# Conclusion 
This tiffin management project bridges the gap between customers seeking nutritious, home-cooked food and housewives who want to leverage their cooking skills for a steady income. It also addresses the issue of unemployment by creating job opportunities for delivery personnel. By building this platform using the MERN stack, the project ensures scalability, maintainability, and a seamless user experience. The platform will continue to evolve, adding more features to enhance the user and kitchen onboarding experience while improving logistics and delivery efficiency.
